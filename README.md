# Integration-of-Deeplabv3-with-SAM
Developed a hybrid DeepLabV3–SAM pipeline for precise road extraction from satellite imagery. Applied normalization and contrast enhancement, generated coarse masks via DeepLabV3, refined them using SAM prompts, and applied morphological closing, thinning, and gap filling for continuity.
